IoT task generation

This project read a Google cluster trace and divides it into 5-min time intervals.
Some characteristics are added to the tasks in this project such as deadline and the target edge node to which
the task is propagated. 
The tasks are going to be input to the networks with different settings. 
We have 5 networks with the size set {200,400,600,800,1000}.
Therefore, the tasks are assigned to different edge node's id based on the network size. 
This id is produced according to two different distributions include Beta and Random.
